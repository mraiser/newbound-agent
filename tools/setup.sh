# With no path argument the current directory is used if it is a newbound
# checkout; otherwise a `newbound` directory beside this repo.
#
# Idempotent: on a fully set-up checkout every step short-circuits and the
# whole run takes seconds. On a fresh clone it is the complete first-time
# sequence from the README (overlay -> cmd scaffold -> host build ->
# `newbound rebuild` -> host build -> dylibs), then the app staging the
# overlay otherwise misses (the platform's install_lib step: the server
# serves only apps listed in config.properties, and runtime/agent must
# carry the app shell), followed by the git hygiene that keeps regenerated
# local state out of accidental commits:
#
#   - newbound repo: Cargo.toml (workspace exclude), Cargo.lock, the
#     generated initializer, and newbound_core/src/api.rs are rewritten
#     by `newbound rebuild` and must never be committed there -> marked
#     skip-worktree (undo: git update-index --no-skip-worktree <file>).
#   - agent repo: the rebuild regenerates each FFI crate's src/api.rs
#     against the libraries present in THIS checkout, deleting stubs for
#     libraries that exist elsewhere (camera, hollis, ...). That churn is
#     environment-induced, not authored, so it is reverted -- unless the
#     file was already modified before setup ran, in which case it is
#     left alone as in-progress work.
