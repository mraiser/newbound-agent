"""Write the empty `cmd` crate scaffold into a newbound checkout.

`/cmd` is gitignored in the newbound repo BECAUSE it is generated —
`newbound rebuild` emits it for whichever store libraries declare
`"root": "cmd"`. A checkout that redacts (or simply lacks) such a
library still needs the crate to exist so Cargo.toml's
`cmd = { path = "./cmd" }` resolves. This writes the empty scaffold the
builder would produce; a checkout that has the libraries regenerates
over it.

Usage: gen-cmd-crate.py <newbound-checkout-dir>
Refuses to touch an existing cmd/src (never overwrites real content).
